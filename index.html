                <p class="plan-text-description">We all love the winter season, but when it gets extremely cold outside,
                    life gets tough for us. During winters, all you would want to do is stay cooped up in the house and
                    if you are a new mom, you would want to protect your baby from the harsh winds blowing outside. As
                    your babyâ€™s immune system will be still developing, he will be susceptible to colds and infections
                    and that is bound to leave you worried. But by taking preventive measures, you can keep your little
                    one warm and safe. Read on to learn about newborn baby care during the winter season.</p>
